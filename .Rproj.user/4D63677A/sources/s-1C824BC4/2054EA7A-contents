## Read in our data so we can see it and make plots with it
## Need to learn a few things first: functions and objects
# 30 min

#### Functions ####
# - built-in procedure that automates something for you
# - you input arguments into a function and the function returns a value

# square root function
sqrt(2)
# ?sqrt

# Most functions take multiple arguments. But there are usually defaults that are used if you don't specify anything for that argument.
# round a number
round(3.14159)
?round
# change number of digits to 2
round(3.14159, digits = 2)
# if you provide the arguments in the exact same order as they are defined, you don't have to name them
round(3.14159, 2)

# Exercise
# Which of the following lines of code will give you an output of 3.14? For the one(s) that donâ€™t give you 3.14, what do they give you?
round(x = 3.14159)
round(x = 3.14159, digits = 2)
round(digits = 2, x = 3.14159)
round(2, 3.14159)

#### Objects ####
# - Storage boxes so you can save information for later reference and more easily manipulate it

# store square root to object
first_sqrt <- sqrt(16)
# print (access) first_sqrt
first_sqrt
# get square root of square root (manipulate first_sqrt)
second_sqrt <- sqrt(first_sqrt)
second_sqrt
# can change variable content directly
first_sqrt <- sqrt(10)
# objects aren't automatically updated like in a spreadsheet
first_sqrt
second_sqrt

# Exercise - what is my_number after these three lines are run?
# 10, 15, 17, 22
my_number <- 10
my_number + 5
my_number <- my_number + 7

# Object names
# - can't start with number
# - no spaces
# - best practice to not include periods 

# Exercise
# Which of these object names will throw an error?
# After running all four lines of code below, what value do you think the object Flower holds?
1number <- 3
Flower <- "marigold"
flower <- "rose"
favorite number <- 12

# load in library
library(tidyverse)
# packages tab 

# read in data
gapminder_1997 <- read_csv("data/gapminder_1997.csv")

# Exercise - what function would you use to read in an excel file?
# (use the internet)

## End: 10:00

### First plot! 
## 30 min

### Stickies!!!
