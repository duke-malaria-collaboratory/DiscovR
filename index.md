This is a custom curriculum developed by members of The Duke Malaria Collaboratory for the DiscovR workshop (Data integration: strategies, concepts, and visualization in R). 
While it is based on The Carpentries curriculum and teaching practices, 
it is not officially overseen by The Carpentries organization. 
We welcome any feedback or questions to us through 
[GitHub](https://github.com/duke-malaria-collaboratory/DiscovR-workshop). 

The curriculum is developed for complete beginners interested in 
learning reproducible data science techniques and integrates instruction 
of R for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. For more details, please see 
[Introduction to the Workshop]({{ page.root }}/00-intro). 

If you are interested in contributing to the curriculum, please read over 
[The Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook](https://carpentries.github.io/curriculum-development/) 
and [our contribution guidelines][contributing]. If you would like to set
