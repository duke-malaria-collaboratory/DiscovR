# START: 9:30 (REMEMBER: TEA BREAK 10:30-11:00)

# read in data (full dataset with many years)
smoking <- read_csv('data/smoking_cancer.csv')

# summarize data
summarize(smoking, mean_smoke_pct=mean(smoke_pct))

# pipes - pass data value to summarize ("and then") - useful for chaining together multiple functions
# different from + in ggplot, which layers on additional information
# good practice to "Enter" after each pipe
# keyboard shortcut - control + shift + M
smoking %>%
    summarize(mean_smoke_pct = mean(smoke_pct))

# can create more than one summary (separate by commas)
smoking %>%
    summarize(mean_smoke_pct = mean(smoke_pct),

              max_smoke_pct = max(smoke_pct))

# Exercise: use the piping function and summarize() to find the earliest year in the dataset

# Solution:
smoking %>%
    summarize(earliest_year = min(year))

# dataset contains many years and countries - what if we want to summarize data for just the first year?
# filter will keep only certain rows
smoking %>%
    filter(year = 1990) %>%
    summarize(mean_smoke_pct_1990=mean(smoke_pct))
# error - need a double equals

smoking %>%

    summarize(mean_smoke_pct_1990=mean(smoke_pct))

# Exercise: What is the mean percent of people with lung cancer for the most recent year in the dataset?
# Bonus: Figure out a way to write the code so you don't have to type the year into filter.  (Typing in the year is an example of hard-coding and we try to avoid it because if the data changes the number might also change.)

# Solution
smoking %>%
    summarize(recent_year=max(year))
smoking %>%
    filter(year == 2019) %>%
    summarize(mean_cancer_pct=mean(lung_cancer_pct))

# Solution
smoking %>%
    filter(year == 2019) %>%
    ggplot() +
    aes(x = continent) +
    geom_bar()

# what if we want to get the counts themselves?

# new column in dataset - mutate()
# estimate of number of people who smoke
smoking %>%

# Exercise: make a new column in our dataset called pop_mil that is the population in millions
# Solution
smoking %>%

# keep or remove certain columns - select()

# Bonus: Use what youâ€™ve learned from today to figure out which countries had higher smoking percentage in 2010 than 1990.
