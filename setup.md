## Pre-workshop setup steps

For the workshop, you will need to have a few software packages installed. 

_Note_: If you don't have internet access or are having trouble downloading or installing anything, let us know!
We will help you troubleshoot, and if we can't figure it out we will have USB drives at the workshop for you to use to get the required programs onto your computer. 

If you have internet access:

1. Install the following software (<a href="#install">all instructions are below</a>).
    - [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
    - [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), an integrated development environment for R
1. After you have installed everything above, download [un-report.zip](https://github.com/duke-malaria-collaboratory/DiscovR/raw/main/files/un-report.zip). You'll need the files included during the workshop.
    1. Move `un-report.zip` to your Desktop and unzip it (usually double-clicking it will work).
    1. Start up **RStudio**. In the upper left menu, select `File` > `Open`. In the window that opens, go to the `un-report/` folder on your Desktop and select the file `check_setup.R` to open it in RStudio.
    1. Click the **`Source`** button to run the script. This script will make sure that everything is installed and setup correctly. You should see output printed to the console window (usually the lower left pane in RStudio). _Note that there will be some red text that prints out to the screen. This doesn't necessarily mean you got an error unless it says `Error` somewhere!_ 
    1. Take a screenshot of the console output (or copy & paste it) into an email and send it to the lead instructor. If there were issues, they'll help you get everything setup correctly.

If at any point you get stuck or run into problems, please don't hesitate to ask us for help!
