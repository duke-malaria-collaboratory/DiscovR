# Day 1 review

#### Opening your Rproject in RStudio.

First, navigate to the `un-reports` directory however you'd like and open `un-report.Rproj`.
This should open the un-report R project in RStudio.
You can check this by seeing if the Files in the bottom right of RStudio are the ones in your `un-report` directory. 

#### Creating a new R script.

Then create a new R Script file for our work. Open RStudio. Choose "File" \> "New File" \> "RScript". Save this file as `un_data_analysis.R`. 

#### Loading your data.

Start by importing the dataset that we used yesterday into our fresh new R session: `smoking <- read_csv('data/smoking_cancer_1990.csv')`.

What error do you get and why? Fix the code so you don't get an error and read in the dataset.

> ## Solution
>
> If we look in the console now, we'll see we've received an error message saying that R "could not find the function `read_csv()`". *Hint: Packages...*
> What this means is that R cannot find the function we are trying to call. The reason for this usually is that we are trying to run a function from a package that we have not yet loaded. This is a very common error message that you will probably see a lot when using R. It's important to remember that you will need to load any packages you want to use into R each time you start a new session. The `read_csv` function comes from the `readr` package which is included in the `tidyverse` package so we will just load the `tidyverse` package and run the import code again:

#### Investigating population by continent.
_[Back to top](#contents)_

Next, make plot comparing the population of countries on different continents. Feel free to look back at the content from yesterday if you want!

Bonus 1: Change the y axis to a log10 scale so that you can see the spread in the data a bit better. 

Bonus 2: Make the plot prettier by changing the axis labels, theme, and anything else you want. Feel free to look back at the material from yesterday and/or use the Internet to help.

It seems like there are a couple outliers. By the end of today, we'll be able to identify what countries those are. 

# Overview of the lesson
_[Back to top](#contents)_

Yesterday we spent a lot of time making plots in R using the ggplot2 package. Visualizing data using plots is a very powerful skill in R, but what if we would like to work with only a subset of our data? Or clean up messy data, calculate summary statistics, create a new variable, or join two datasets together? There are several different methods for doing this in R, and we will touch on a few today using functions the `dplyr` package, which is also part of the `tidyverse`.

# An introduction to data analysis in R using `dplyr` {#intro-data-analysis}

First, we're going to read in a dataset with data for multiple years:


~~~
smoking <- read_csv('data/smoking_cancer.csv')
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Rows: 5749 Columns: 6
── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Delimiter: ","
chr (2): country, continent
dbl (4): year, pop, smoke_pct, lung_cancer_pct

ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
~~~
{: .output}


## Get stats fast with `summarize()` {#get-stats-fast-with-summarize}
[*Back to top*](#contents)

Let's say we would like to know the mean (average) smoking rate in the dataset. R has a built in function function called `mean()` that will calculate this value for us. We can apply that function to our smoking_pct column using the `summarize()` function. Here's what that looks like:


~~~
summarize(smoking, mean_smoke_pct=mean(smoke_pct))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 1 × 1
  mean_smoke_pct
           <dbl>
1           21.7
~~~
{: .output}

When we call `summarize()`, we can use any of the column names of our data object as values to pass to other functions. `summarize()` will return a new data object and our value will be returned as a column.

> **Note:** The `summarize()` and `summarise()` functions perform identical functions.

The `mean_smoke_pct=` part tells `summarize()` to use "mean_smoke_pct" as the name of the new column. Note that you don't have to have quotes around this new name as long as it starts with a letter and doesn't include a space.

Instead of including the data object as an argument, we can use the *pipe operator* `%>%` to pass the data value into the `summarize` function. You can think of `%>%` as another way to type "and then."


~~~
smoking %>% summarize(mean_smoke_pct=mean(smoke_pct))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 1 × 1
  mean_smoke_pct
           <dbl>
1           21.7
~~~
{: .output}
 
This line of code will do the exact same thing as our first summary command, but the piping function tells R to use the `smoking` dataframe as the first argument in the next function.

This lets us "chain" together multiple functions, which will be helpful later. Note that the pipe (`%>%`) is a bit different from using the ggplot plus (`+`). Pipes take the output from the left side and use it as input to the right side. In other words, it tells R to do the function on the left *and then* the function on the right. In contrast, plusses layer on additional information (right side) to a preexisting plot (left side). 
 
We can also add an <kbd>Enter</kbd> to make it look nicer:  


~~~
smoking %>%
  summarize(mean_smoke_pct=mean(smoke_pct))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 1 × 1
  mean_smoke_pct
           <dbl>
1           21.7
~~~
{: .output}

Using the *pipe operator* `%>%` and <kbd>Enter</kbd> makes our code more readable. The  *pipe operator* `%>%` also helps to avoid using nested functions and minimizes the need for new variables.

Since we use the pipe operator so often, there is a keyboard shortcut for it in RStudio. You can press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd> on Windows or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd> on a Mac.

When you call `summarize()`, you can also create more than one new column. To do so, you must separate your columns with a comma. Building on the code from above, let's add a new column that calculates the minimum and maximum percent of smokers. 


~~~
smoking %>%
  summarize(mean_smoke_pct=mean(smoke_pct),
            min_smoke_pct=min(smoke_pct),
            max_smoke_pct=max(smoke_pct))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 1 × 3
  mean_smoke_pct min_smoke_pct max_smoke_pct
           <dbl>         <dbl>         <dbl>
1           21.7          3.06          52.1
~~~
{: .output}

## Narrow down rows with `filter()` {#narrow-down-rows-with-filter}
[*Back to top*](#contents)

Let's take a look at the value we just calculated, which tells us the average percent of smokers for all rows in the data was 21.7. But the dataset contains rows from many different years and many different countries. It's possible that the percent of smokers has changed overtime, so it may not make sense to average over all the years at the same time.

So we see that the earliest year in the dataset is 1990. Let's calculate the average percent of smokers for all countries for only that year. To do that, we will use the `filter()` function to only use rows for that year before calculating the mean value.


~~~
smoking %>%
  filter(year = 1990) %>%
  summarize(mean_smoke_pct_1990=mean(smoke_pct))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
Error in `filter()`:
! We detected a named input.
ℹ This usually means that you've used `=` instead of `==`.
ℹ Did you mean `year == 1990`?
~~~
{: .error}

Oops! We got an error, but don't panic. Error messages are often pretty useful. 
In this case, it says that that we used `=` instead of `==`. 
That's because we use `=` (single equals) when naming arguments that you are passing to functions.
So here R thinks we're trying to assign 1990 to year, kind of like we do in the summarize function.
What we really want to do is find all of the years that are equal to 1990. 
To do this, we have to use `==` (double equals), which we use when testing if two values are equal to each other:


~~~
smoking %>%
  filter(year == 1990) %>%
  summarize(mean_smoke_pct_1990=mean(smoke_pct))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 1 × 1
  mean_smoke_pct_1990
                <dbl>
1                23.9
~~~
{: .output}

Notice how the pipe operator (`%>%`) allows us to combine these two simple steps into a more complicated data extraction? We took the data, filtered out the rows, then took the mean value. The argument we pass to `filter()` needs to be some expression that will return TRUE or FALSE. We can use comparisons like `>` (greater than) and `<` (less than) for example. Here we tested for equality using a double equals sign `==`.

## Grouping rows using `group_by()` {#grouping-rows-using-group_by}
[*Back to top*](#contents)

We previously saw that the mean percent of smokers is larger in 1990 than the value we got using all of the rows. But now we might be interested in calculating the average for each year. Rather that doing a bunch of different `filter()` statements, we can instead use the `group_by()` function. The function allows us to treat the rows in logical groups, so rather than summarizing over all the rows, we will get one summary value for each group. Here's what that will look like:


~~~
smoking %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(average=mean(smoke_pct))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 30 × 2
    year average
   <dbl>   <dbl>
 1  1990    23.9
 2  1991    23.7
 3  1992    23.6
 4  1993    23.4
 5  1994    23.3
 6  1995    23.1
 7  1996    23.0
 8  1997    22.9
 9  1998    22.7
10  1999    22.6
# … with 20 more rows
~~~
{: .output}

The `group_by()` function expects you to pass in the name of a column (or multiple columns separated by commas) in your data. 

Note that you might get a message about the summarize function regrouping the output by 'year'. This simply indicates what the function is grouping by. 

We can also group by multiple variables. In this case, we separate the variables with commas:


~~~
smoking %>%
  group_by(year, continent) %>%
  summarize(average=mean(smoke_pct))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
`summarise()` has grouped output by 'year'. You can override using the
`.groups` argument.
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
# A tibble: 180 × 3
# Groups:   year [30]

## Make new variables with `mutate()` {#make-new-variables-with-mutate}
[*Back to top*](#contents)

Each time we ran `summarize()`, we got back fewer rows than passed in. We either got one row back, or one row per group. But sometimes we want to create a new column in our data without changing the number of rows. The function we use to create new columns is called `mutate()`.

We have a column for the population and the percent of people who smoke. If we wanted to get an estimate of the number of people who smoke, we could multiply the percentages by the total population. Here's what such a `mutate()` command would look like:


~~~
smoking %>%
  mutate(smoke_n = pop * smoke_pct/100)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 5,749 × 7

This will add a new column called "smoke_n" to our data. We use the column names as if they were regular values that we want to perform mathematical operations on and provide the name in front of an equals sign like we have done with `summarize()`

## Subset columns using `select()` {#subset-columns-using-select}

[*Back to top*](#contents)

We use the `filter()` function to choose a subset of the rows from our data, but when we want to choose a subset of columns from our data we use `select()`. For example, if we only wanted to see the population ("pop") and year values, we can do:


~~~
smoking %>%
  select(pop, year)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 5,749 × 2
         pop  year
       <dbl> <dbl>
 1  41335188  1990
 2    311869  1990
 3   8975597  1990
 4    223159  1990
 5   4615843  1990
 6 249623000  1990
 7  10333355  1990
 8   2969097  1990
 9   9983218  1990
10  10196792  1990
# … with 5,739 more rows
~~~
{: .output}

We can also use `select()` to drop/remove particular columns by putting a minus sign (`-`) in front of the column name. For example, if we want everything but the continent column, we can do:


~~~
smoking %>%
  select(-continent)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~

> The `select()` function has a bunch of helper functions that are handy if you are working with a dataset that has a lot of columns. You can see these helper functions on the `?select` help page. For example, let's say we wanted to select the year column and all the columns that start with the letter "c". You can do that with:

## Changing the shape of the data

[*Back to top*](#contents)

Data comes in many shapes and sizes, and one way we classify data is either "wide" or "long." Data that is "long" has one row per observation. The `smoking` data is in a long format. We have one row for each country for each year and each different measurement for that country is in a different column. We might describe this data as "tidy" because it makes it easy to work with `ggplot2` and `dplyr` functions (this is where the "tidy" in "tidyverse" comes from). As tidy as it may be, sometimes we may want our data in a "wide" format. Typically in "wide" format each row represents a group of observations and each value is placed in a different column rather than a different row. For example maybe we want only one row per country and want to spread the percent of smokers values into different columns (one for each year).

The `tidyr` package contains the functions `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()` that make it easy to switch between the two formats. The `tidyr` package is included in the `tidyverse` package so we don't need to do anything to load it.

First, our data is not as clean as it looks - there are some countries that have multiple entries for a given year. 
However, we want only one entry per year. 
To get this, we will summarize the data to be the mean of all values for a given year:


~~~
smoking %>%
  group_by(country, continent, year) %>% 
  summarize(smoke_pct = mean(smoke_pct))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
`summarise()` has grouped output by 'country', 'continent'. You can override
using the `.groups` argument.
~~~
{: .output}



~~~

10 Afghanistan Asia       1999      5.37
# … with 5,709 more rows
~~~
{: .output}

Notice how we went from having 5749 rows to 5719 in our data. 

Next, let's create a wide version of the data using `pivot_wider()`:


~~~
smoking %>%
  group_by(country, continent, year) %>% 
  summarize(smoke_pct = mean(smoke_pct)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = smoke_pct)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
`summarise()` has grouped output by 'country', 'continent'. You can override
using the `.groups` argument.

~~~
{: .output}

Notice here that we tell `pivot_wider()` which columns to pull the names we wish our new columns to be named from the year variable, and the values to populate those columns from the `smoke_pct` variable. (Again, neither of which have to be in quotes in the code when there are no special characters or spaces - certainly an incentive not to use special characters or spaces!) We see that the resulting table has new columns by year, and the values populate it with our remaining variables dictating the rows.

## Plotting wide data

Let's make a plot with our wide data comparing percent of smokers in 1990 to percent of smokers in 2010 to see how it has changed for each country.


~~~
smoking %>%
  group_by(country, continent, year) %>% 
  summarize(smoke_pct = mean(smoke_pct)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = smoke_pct) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = 1990, y = 2010)) +
  geom_point()
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
`summarise()` has grouped output by 'country', 'continent'. You can override
using the `.groups` argument.
~~~
{: .output}

<img src="../fig/rmd-03-unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-10" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-10" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Hmm that's not what we want. `ggplot` just plotted the numbers 1990 and 2010 instead of the data from the years. That's because it evaluates those as numbers instead of column names. To fix this, we can add a prefix to the years in `pivot_wider()`:


~~~
smoking %>%
  group_by(country, continent, year) %>% 
  summarize(smoke_pct = mean(smoke_pct)) %>%

Alright, now we have a plot with the mean percent of smokers in in 1990 on the x axis and the mean percent of smokers in 2010 on the y axis, and each point represents a country. However, the different ranges on the x and y axis make it hard to compare the points. 
Let's fix that by adding a line at y=x. 


~~~
smoking %>%
  group_by(country, continent, year) %>% 
  summarize(smoke_pct = mean(smoke_pct)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = smoke_pct, names_prefix = 'y') %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = y1990, y = y2010)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1)

It seems like in most countries the percent of smokers has decreased from 1990 to 2010, since most of the points fall below the line y = x. However, there are some countries where smoking has increased (i.e. the points are above the line y = x). Let's figure out which those are!
