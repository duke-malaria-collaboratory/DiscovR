# Introduction to R and RStudio
_[Back to top](#contents)_

To perform exploratory analyses, we need the data we want to explore and a platform to analyze the data.

You already [downloaded the data]({{ page.root }}/setup.html). But what platform will we use to analyze the data? We have many options!

We could try to use a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google sheets that have limited access, less flexibility, and don't easily allow for things that are critical to ["reproducible" research](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285), like easily sharing the steps used to explore and make changes to the original data.

We could also use a program like SAS or STATA, which are used by many epidemiologists. However, these programs are not freely available, the graphics are not as customizable, and there are not a ton of specialized packages for different niche analyses.

Instead, we'll use a more general programming language to test our hypothesis. Today we will use R, but we could have also used Python for the same reasons we chose R. Both R and Python are freely available, the instructions you use to do the analysis are easily shared, and by using reproducible practices, it's straightforward to add more data or to change settings like colors or the size of a plotting symbol. 

> ## But why R and not Python?
> [There's no great reason](http://www.academichermit.com/2020/03/23/Why-R.html).
> Although there are subtle differences between the languages, it's ultimately a matter of personal preference. Both are powerful and popular languages that have very well developed and welcoming communities of scientists that use them. As you learn more about R, you may find things that are annoying in R that aren't so annoying in Python; the same could be said of learning Python. If the community you work in uses R, then you're in the right place.

To run R, all you really need is the R program, which is available for computers running the Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux operating systems. You downloaded R while getting [set up]({{ page.root }}/setup.html) for this workshop.

To make your life in R easier, there is a great (and free!) program called RStudio that you also downloaded and used during [set up]({{ page.root }}/setup.html). As we work today, we'll use features that are available in RStudio for writing and running code, managing projects, installing packages, getting help, and much more. It is important to remember that R and RStudio are different, but complementary programs. You need R to use RStudio.

To get started, we'll spend a little time getting familiar with the RStudio environment and setting it up to suit your tastes. When you start RStudio, you'll have three panels.

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/initial_rstudio.png" width="700"/>

On the left you'll have a panel with three tabs - Console, Terminal, and Jobs. The Console tab is what running R from the command line looks like. This is where you can enter R code. Try typing in `2+2` at the prompt (>). In the upper right panel are tabs indicating the Environment, History, and a few other things. If you click on the History tab, you'll see the command you ran at the R prompt.

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/history.png" width="700"/>

In the lower right panel are tabs for Files, Plots, Packages, Help, and Viewer. 

We'll spend more time in each of these tabs as we go through the workshop, so we won't spend a lot of time discussing them now.

Let's get going on our analysis!

One of the helpful features in RStudio is the ability to create a project. A project is a special directory that contains all of the code and data that you will need to run an analysis.

At the top of your screen you'll see the "File" menu. Select that menu and then the menu for "New Project...".

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/new_project_menu.png" width="600"/>

When the smaller window opens, select "Existing Directory" and then the "Browse" button in the next window.

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/existing_directory.png" width="600"/>

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/browse.png" width="600"/>

Navigate to the directory that contains your code and data from the setup instructions and click the "Open" button.

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/navigate_to_project.png" width="600"/>

Then click the "Create Project" button.

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/create_project.png" width="600"/>

Did you notice anything change?

In the lower right corner of your RStudio session, you should notice that your
Files tab is now your project directory. You'll also see a file called
un-report.Rproj in that directory.

From now on, you should start RStudio by double clicking on that file. This will
make sure you are in the correct directory when you run your analysis.

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/files_with_rproj.png" width="600"/>

We'd like to create a file where we can keep track of our R code.

Back in the "File" menu, you'll see the first option is "New File". Selecting "New File" opens another menu to the right and the first option is "R Script". Select "R Script".

Now we have a fourth panel in the upper left corner of RStudio that includes an **Editor** tab with an untitled R Script. Let's save this file as `intro_to_r.R` in our project directory.

We will be entering R code into the **Editor** tab to run in our **Console** panel.

On line 1 of `intro_to_r.R`, type `2+2`.

With your cursor on the line with the `2+2`, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> on your keyboard. 
You should be able to see that `2+2` was run in the Console.
(You can also click <kbd>Run</kbd> in the top right side of the **Editor**, but this isn't quite as easy.)

As you write more code, you can highlight multiple lines and then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>, orclick <kbd>Run</kbd>, to run all of the lines you have selected.

# Foundational topics

## Functions

Functions are built-in procedures that automate a task for you.
You input arguments into a function and the function returns a value. 
We'll go over a few math functions to get our feet wet.

You call a function in R by typing it's name followed by opening then closing parenthesis. Each function has a purpose, which is often hinted at by the name of the function. 

Let's start with the `sqrt()` function.

Let's try to run the function without anything inside the parenthesis.

```{r FunctionAlone}
sqrt()
```

We get an error message. Don't panic! Error messages pop up all the time, and can be super helpful in debugging code.

In this case, the message tells us zero arguments were passed to the function, but we need to input at least one. 
Many functions, including `sqrt`, require additional pieces of information to do their job. 
We call these additional values "arguments" or "parameters." 
You pass **arguments** to a function by placing values in between the parenthesis. 
A function takes in these arguments and does a bunch of "magic" behind the scenes to output something we're interested in.

For example, we want to provide a number to `sqrt()`, namely the number we want the square root of: 

```{r, sqrt}
sqrt(4)
```

Here, the input argument is 4, and the output is 2, just like we'd expect. 

Now let's do an example where we might not know the expected output:

```{r}
sqrt(2)
```

Great, now let's move onto a slightly more complicated function. 
If we want to round a number, we can use the `round()` function:

```{r}
round(3.14159)
```

Why did this round to three? What if we want it to round to a different number of digits?

`round()` has two arguments: the numeric input and the number of digits to round to.
>
{: .callout}

We can use the digits argument in `round()` to change how many decimal places are kept:

```{r}
round(3.14159, digits = 2)
```

Sometimes it is helpful - or even necessary - to include the argument name, but often we can skip the argument name, if the argument values are passed in the order they are defined:

```{r}
round(3.14159, 2)
```

> ## Position of the arguments in functions
> Which of the following lines of code will give you an output of 3.14? For the one(s) that don't give you 3.14, what do they give you?
>
> ```{r functionPositionExercise, eval = FALSE}
> round(x = 3.1415)
> round("3.14159", 2)
> round(x = 3.1415, digits = 2)
> round(digits = 2, x = 3.1415)
> round(2, 3.1415)
> ```
> {: .source}
>
> > ## Solution
> > The 2nd and 3rd lines will give you the right answer because the arguments are named, and when you use names the order doesn't matter. The 1st line will give you 3 because the default number of digits is 0. Then 4th line will give you 2 because, since you didn't name the arguments, x=2 and digits=3.1415.

If all this function stuff sounds confusing, don't worry! We'll see a bunch of examples as we go that will make things clearer.


## Objects

Sometimes we want to store information for later use or manipulation. 
To do this in R, we store the information, or _object_ , in a variable name that you can think of like a storage box.

Let's say we want to round the square root of a number.
One way we can do this is to put a function inside a function:

```{r}
round(sqrt(2), 2)
```

Another way is to store the square root output first, and then round that. 

To store an object for later, we have to decide on a name of the box we want to store it in first. Let's say we want to call it `square_root`.
Then we have to tell R what we want to put in the object name. We use the `<-` symbol, which is the **assignment operator** to assign values generated or typed on the right to object names on the left. An alternative symbol that you might see used as an **assignment operator** is the `=` but it is clearer to only use `<-` for assignment. We use this symbol so often that RStudio has a keyboard short cut for it: <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd> on Windows, and <kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd> on Mac. 

Let's assign `sqrt(2)` to the object `square_root`. We can see that `square_root` contains the square root of 2:

```{r}
square_root <- sqrt(2)
square_root
```

In R terms, `square_root` is a named **object** that references or stores something. In this case, `square_root` stores the square root of 2.

Notice that we also have a new value in our environment in the upper right hand corner of RStudio.
This panel lists all of the objects that we have stored in our environment, 
it's kind of like a view into our storage room (environment) of all the boxes (objects) of things we have access to. 

Now let's round the square root of 2 to 2 decimal places:

```{r}
sqrt_rounded <- round(square_root, 2)
sqrt_rounded
```

This is a fairly straightforward example, but you'll see the usefulness of storing things in variables as the workshop progresses. 

Now, what happens to `sqrt_rounded` if we update `square_root`?

```{r}
square_root <- sqrt(4)
square_root
sqrt_rounded
```

It doesn't update! That's because we haven't re-run the code that rounded `square_root`. 
The values don't update automatically like in a spreadsheet.

# Exercise - what is my_number after these three lines are run?
# 10, 15, 17, 22
my_number <- 10
my_number + 5
my_number <- my_number + 7

> ## Predicting object contents

> 1. 10
> 1. 15
> 1. 17

> > ## Solution

> ## Guidelines on naming objects
> - You want your object names to be explicit and not too long.
> - They cannot start with a number (2x is not valid, but x2 is).
> - R is case sensitive, so for example, weight is different from Weight.
> - You cannot use spaces in the name.
> - There are some names that cannot be used because they are the names of fundamental functions in R (e.g., if, else, for; see [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html) for a complete list). If in doubt, check the help to see if the name is already in use (`?function_name`).
> - It's best to avoid dots (.) within names. Many function names in R itself have them and dots also have a special meaning (methods) in R and other programming languages.
> - It is recommended to use nouns for object names and verbs for function names.
> - Be consistent in the styling of your code, such as where you put spaces, how you name objects, etc. Using a consistent coding style makes your code clearer to read for your future self and your collaborators. One popular style guide can be found through the [tidyverse](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
{: .checklist}

> ## Bonus Exercise: Bad names for objects
> Try to assign values to some new variable names. What do you notice? After running all four lines of code below, what value do you think the variable `Flower` holds?
>
> ```{r BadObjects, eval = FALSE}
> 1number <- 3
> Flower <- "marigold"
> flower <- "rose"
> favorite number <- 12
> ```
> {: .source}
>
> > ## Solution
> > Notice that we get an error when we try to assign values to `1number` and `favorite number`. This is because we cannot start an object name with a numeral and we cannot have spaces in object names. The object `Flower` still holds "marigold." This is because R is case-sensitive, so running `flower <- "rose"` does NOT change the `Flower` object. This can get confusing, and is why we generally avoid having objects with the same name and different capitalization.

# Glossary of terms
_[Back to top](#contents)_

- Comments: lines or parts of lines that are not run. In R, comments start with a `#`. 
- Function: takes input and generates output.
- Object: way to store information for later use and manipulation.
