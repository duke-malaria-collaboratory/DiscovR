# Introduction to R and RStudio
_[Back to top](#contents)_

In this session we will be testing the hypothesis that a country's life expectancy is related to the total value of its finished goods and services, also known as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
To test this hypothesis, we'll need two things: data and a platform to analyze the data.

You already [have the data]({{ page.root }}/setup.html). But what platform will we use to analyze the data? We have many options!

We could try to use a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel or Google sheets that have limited access, less flexibility, and don't easily allow for things that are critical to ["reproducible" research](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285), like easily sharing the steps used to explore and make changes to the original data.

We could also use a program like SAS or STATA, which are used by many epidemiologists. However, these programs are not freely available, the graphics are not as customizable, and there are not a ton of specialized packages for different niche analyses.

Instead, we'll use a more general programming language to test our hypothesis. Today we will use R, but we could have also used Python for the same reasons we chose R. Both R and Python are freely available, the instructions you use to do the analysis are easily shared, and by using reproducible practices, it's straightforward to add more data or to change settings like colors or the size of a plotting symbol. 

> ## But why R and not Python?
> [There's no great reason](http://www.academichermit.com/2020/03/23/Why-R.html).
> Although there are subtle differences between the languages, it's ultimately a matter of personal preference. Both are powerful and popular languages that have very well developed and welcoming communities of scientists that use them. As you learn more about R, you may find things that are annoying in R that aren't so annoying in Python; the same could be said of learning Python. If the community you work in uses R, then you're in the right place.

To run R, all you really need is the R program, which is available for computers running the Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux operating systems. You installed R while getting [set up]({{ page.root }}/setup.html) for this workshop.

To make your life in R easier, there is a great (and free!) program called RStudio that you also installed and used during [set up]({{ page.root }}/setup.html). As we work today, we'll use features that are available in RStudio for writing and running code, managing projects, installing packages, getting help, and much more. It is important to remember that R and RStudio are different, but complementary programs. You need R to use RStudio.

> ## The tidyverse vs Base R
> If you've used R before, you may have learned commands that are different than the ones we will be using during this workshop. We will be focusing on functions from the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). The "tidyverse" is a collection of R packages that have been designed to work well together and offer many convenient features that do not come with a fresh install of R (aka "base R"). These packages are very popular and have a lot of developer support including many staff members from RStudio. These functions generally help you to write code that is easier to read and maintain. We believe learning these tools will help you become more productive more quickly.

To get started, we'll spend a little time getting familiar with the RStudio environment and setting it up to suit your tastes. When you start RStudio, you'll have three panels.

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/initial_rstudio.png" width="700"/>

On the left you'll have a panel with three tabs - Console, Terminal, and Jobs. The Console tab is what running R from the command line looks like. This is where you can enter R code. Try typing in `2+2` at the prompt (>). In the upper right panel are tabs indicating the Environment, History, and a few other things. If you click on the History tab, you'll see the command you ran at the R prompt.

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/history.png" width="700"/>

In the lower right panel are tabs for Files, Plots, Packages, Help, and Viewer. You used the Packages tab to install tidyverse.

We'll spend more time in each of these tabs as we go through the workshop, so we won't spend a lot of time discussing them now.

Let's get going on our analysis!

One of the helpful features in RStudio is the ability to create a project. A project is a special directory that contains all of the code and data that you will need to run an analysis.

At the top of your screen you'll see the "File" menu. Select that menu and then the menu for "New Project...".

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/new_project_menu.png" width="600"/>

When the smaller window opens, select "Existing Directory" and then the "Browse" button in the next window.

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/existing_directory.png" width="600"/>

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/browse.png" width="600"/>

Navigate to the directory that contains your code and data from the setup instructions and click the "Open" button.

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/navigate_to_project.png" width="600"/>

Then click the "Create Project" button.

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/create_project.png" width="600"/>

Did you notice anything change?

In the lower right corner of your RStudio session, you should notice that your
Files tab is now your project directory. You'll also see a file called
un-report.Rproj in that directory.

From now on, you should start RStudio by double clicking on that file. This will
make sure you are in the correct directory when you run your analysis.

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/files_with_rproj.png" width="600"/>

We'd like to create a file where we can keep track of our R code.

Back in the "File" menu, you'll see the first option is "New File". Selecting "New File" opens another menu to the right and the first option is "R Script". Select "R Script".

Now we have a fourth panel in the upper left corner of RStudio that includes an **Editor** tab with an untitled R Script. Let's save this file as `gdp_population.R` in our project directory.

We will be entering R code into the **Editor** tab to run in our **Console** panel.

On line 1 of `gdp_population.R`, type `2+2`.

With your cursor on the line with the `2+2`, click the button that says <kbd>Run</kbd>. You should be able to see that `2+2` was run in the Console.

As you write more code, you can highlight multiple lines and then click <kbd>Run</kbd> to run all of the lines you have selected.

Let's delete the line with 2+2 and replace it with `library(tidyverse)`.

Go ahead and run that line in the **Console** by clicking the <kbd>Run</kbd> button on the top right of the **Editor** tab and choosing <kbd>Run Selected Lines</kbd>. This loads a set of useful functions and sample data that makes it easier for us to do complex analyses and create professional visualizations in R.

```{r loadTidyverse, message=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

> ## What's with all those messages???
>

# Loading and reviewing data
_[Back to top](#contents)_

We will import a subsetted file from the gapminder dataset called `gapminder_1997.csv`. There are many ways to import data into R but for your first plot we will use RStudio's file menu to import and display this data. As we move through this process, RStudio will translate these *point and click* commands into code for us.

In RStudio select "File" > "Import Dataset" > "From Text (readr)".

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/import_data.png" width="600"/>

The file is located in the main directory, click the "Browse" button and select the file named `gapminder_1997.csv`. A preview of the data will appear in the window. You can see there are a lot of Import Options listed, but R has chosen the correct defaults for this particular file.

<img src="{{ page.root }}/fig/r-plotting/import_data_file.png" width="600"/>

We can see in that box that our data will be imported with the Name: "gapminder_1997". Also note that this screen will show you all the code that will be run when you import your data in the lower right "Code Preview". Since everything looks good, click the "Import" button to bring your data into R.

After you've imported your data, a table will open in a new tab in the top left corner of RStudio. This is a quick way to browse your data to make sure everything looks like it has been imported correctly. To review the data, click on the new tab.

We see that our data has 5 columns (variables).

Each row contains life expectancy ("lifeExp"), the total population ("pop"), and the per capita gross domestic product ("gdpPercap") for a given country ("country").

There is also a column that says which continent each country is in ("continent"). Note that both North America and South America are combined into one category called "Americas".

After we've reviewed the data, you'll want to make sure to click the tab in the upper left to return to your `gdp_population.R` file so we can start writing some code.

Now look in the **Environment** tab in the upper right corner of RStudio. Here you will see a list of all the objects you've created or imported during your R session. You will now see `gapminder_1997` listed here as well.

Finally, take a look at the **Console** at the bottom left part of the RStudio screen. Here you will see the commands that were run for you to import your data in addition to associated metadata and warnings.

> ## Data objects
> There are many different ways to store data in R. Most objects have a table-like structure with rows and columns. We will refer to these objects generally as "data objects". If you've used R before, you many be used to calling them "data.frames". Functions from the "tidyverse" such as `read_csv()` work with objects called "tibbles", which are a specialized kind of "data.frame." Another common way to store data is a "data.table". All of these types of data objects (tibbles, data.frames, and data.tables) can be used with the commands we will learn in this lesson to make plots. We may sometimes use these terms interchangeably.
{: .callout}

# Understanding commands

Let's start by looking at the code RStudio ran for us by copying and pasting the first line from the console into our `gdp_population.R` file that is open in the **Editor** window.

```{r consoleReadEcho, eval = FALSE}
gapminder_1997 <- read_csv("gapminder_1997.csv")
```
```{r consoleReadEval, echo = FALSE}
gapminder_1997 <- read_csv("data/gapminder_1997.csv")
```

You should now have a line of text in your code file that started with `gapminder` and ends with a `)` symbol.

What if we want to run this command from our code file?

In order to run code that you've typed in the editor, you have a few options. We can click <kbd>Run</kbd> again from the right side of the **Editor** tab but the quickest way to run the code is by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> on your keyboard (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> on Mac).

This will run the line of code that currently contains your cursor and will move your cursor to the next line. Note that when Rstudio runs your code, it basically just copies your code from the **Editor** window to the **Console** window, just like what happened when we selected <kbd>Run Selected Line(s)</kbd>.

Let's take a closer look at the parts of this command.

Starting from the left, the first thing we see is `gapminder_1997`. We viewed the contents of this file after it was imported so we know that `gapminder_1997` acts as a placeholder for our data.

If we highlight just `gapminder_1997` within our code file and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> on our keyboard, what do we see?

We should see a data table outputted, similar to what we saw in the Viewer tab.

In R terms, `gapminder_1997` is a named **object** that references or stores something. In this case, `gapminder_1997` stores a specific table of data.

Looking back at the command in our code file, the second thing we see is a `<-` symbol, which is the **assignment operator**. It assigns values generated or typed on the right to objects on the left. An alternative symbol that you might see used as an **assignment operator** is the `=` but it is clearer to only use `<-` for assignment. We use this symbol so often that RStudio has a keyboard short cut for it: <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd> on Windows, and <kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd> on Mac.


> ## Assigning values to objects

> > ## Solution
> > When we assign a value to an object, the object stores that value so we can access it later. However, if we store a new value in an object we have already created (like when we stored "Harry Potter" in the `name` object), it replaces the old value. The `age` object does not change, because we never assign it a new value.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}


> ## Guidelines on naming objects
> - You want your object names to be explicit and not too long.
> - They cannot start with a number (2x is not valid, but x2 is).
> - R is case sensitive, so for example, weight_kg is different from Weight_kg.
> - You cannot use spaces in the name.
> - There are some names that cannot be used because they are the names of fundamental functions in R (e.g., if, else, for; see [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html) for a complete list). If in doubt, check the help to see if the name is already in use (`?function_name`).
> - It's best to avoid dots (.) within names. Many function names in R itself have them and dots also have a special meaning (methods) in R and other programming languages.
> - It is recommended to use nouns for object names and verbs for function names.
> - Be consistent in the styling of your code, such as where you put spaces, how you name objects, etc. Using a consistent coding style makes your code clearer to read for your future self and your collaborators. One popular style guide can be found through the [tidyverse](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
{: .checklist}

> ## Bonus Exercise: Bad names for objects
> Try to assign values to some new objects. What do you notice? After running all four lines of code bellow, what value do you think the object `Flower` holds?
>
> ```{r BadObjects, eval = FALSE}
> 1number <- 3
> Flower <- "marigold"
> flower <- "rose"
> favorite number <- 12
> ```
> {: .source}
>
> > ## Solution
> > Notice that we get an error when we try to assign values to `1number` and `favorite number`. This is because we cannot start an object name with a numeral and we cannot have spaces in object names. The object `Flower` still holds "marigold." This is because R is case-sensitive, so running `flower <- "rose"` does NOT change the `Flower` object. This can get confusing, and is why we generally avoid having objects with the same name and different capitalization.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

The next part of the command is `read_csv("gapminder_1997.csv")`. This has a few different key parts. The first part is the `read_csv` function. You call a function in R by typing it's name followed by opening then closing parenthesis. Each function has a purpose, which is often hinted at by the name of the function. Let's try to run the function without anything inside the parenthesis.

```{r FunctionAlone}
read_csv()
```

We get an error message. Don't panic! Error messages pop up all the time, and can be super helpful in debugging code.

In this case, the message tells us "argument "file" is missing, with no default. Many functions, including `read_csv`, require additional pieces of information to do their job. We call these additional values "arguments" or "parameters." You pass **arguments** to a function by placing values in between the parenthesis. A function takes in these arguments and does a bunch of "magic" behind the scenes to output something we're interested in.

For example, when we loaded in our data, the command contained `"gapminder_1997.csv"` inside the `read_csv()` function. This is the value we assigned to the file argument. But we didn't say that that was the file. How does that work?

{: .callout}

The `read_csv()` function took the file path we provided, did who-knows-what behind the scenes, and then outputted an R object with the data stored in that csv file. All that, with one short line of code!

Do all functions need arguments? Let's test some other functions:

```{r FunctionsNoArgs}
 Sys.Date()
 getwd()
```


While some functions, like those above, don't need any arguments, in other
functions we may want to use multiple arguments. When we're using multiple
arguments, we separate the arguments with commas. For example, we can use the
`sum()` function to add numbers together:

```{r sumFunctionExample}
sum(5, 6)
```

{: .challenge}

Notice how in this example, we didn't include any argument names. But you can
use argument names if you want:

```{r FunctionAndArgumentEcho, eval = FALSE}
read_csv(file = 'gapminder_1997.csv')
```

```{r FunctionAndArgumentEval, echo = FALSE}
read_csv(file = 'data/gapminder_1997.csv')
```

> ## Position of the arguments in functions

> round(2, 3.1415)

> {: .source}
>
> > ## Solution
> > The 2nd and 3rd lines will give you the right answer because the arguments are named, and when you use names the order doesn't matter. The 1st line will give you 3 because the default number of digits is 0. Then 4th line will give you 2 because, since you didn't name the arguments, x=2 and digits=3.1415.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

Sometimes it is helpful - or even necessary - to include the argument name, but often we can skip the argument name, if the argument values are passed in a certain order. If all this function stuff sounds confusing, don't worry! We'll see a bunch of examples as we go that will make things clearer.

# Glossary of terms
_[Back to top](#contents)_

- Tibble: the way tabular data is stored in R when using the tidyverse. We may also call it a data frame.  
- Function: takes input and generates output (e.g. `read_csv()` takes a file path and outputs a tibble, which is the data from the file.
- Comments: Lines or parts of lines that are not run. In R, comments start with a `#`.
